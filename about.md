My name is Chris Le Roy (brompwnie) and I am a security engineer/tinkerer/hacker/whateverItsCalled based in London.

I sometimes say something useful on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/brompwnie)

I like to livestream Android ramblings on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqCZRfUpl2azw8ZfvCiOIKA/featured)

I started a Android Security meetup in London for Android Devs and Hackers [here](https://skillsmatter.com/groups/10771-android-security-hacking-and-building)
